# Compound Engineering Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that makes each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/EveryInc/every-marketplace
/plugin install compound-engineering
```

## Workflow

```
Plan → Work → Review → Compound → Repeat
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/plan` | Turn feature ideas into detailed GitHub issues |
| `/work` | Execute plans with worktrees and task tracking |
| `/review` | Multi-agent code review before merging |
| `/compound` | Document learnings to make future work easier |

Each cycle compounds: plans inform future plans, reviews catch more issues, patterns get documented.
